### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
responsive images can significantly improve the site's performance by reducing the file size and load time, especially on mobile devices with slower connections. This can improve user experience and increase the site's search engine ranking.
Secondly, responsive images can make a site more accessible for users with visual impairments or disabilities. By optimizing images for different screen sizes and resolutions, developers can ensure that all users can access the content without difficulty.

### Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used. 
The srcset attribute is used to provide multiple image sources with different resolutions for a browser to choose from based on the device's screen size and pixel density. The sizes attribute is used to specify the size of the image container, which helps the browser to determine the appropriate image to load.
<img src="image.jpg"
     srcset="image-400.jpg 400w,
             image-800.jpg 800w,
             image-1200.jpg 1200w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px,
            (max-width: 900px) 800px,
            1200px"
     alt="example image">

### How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
     images typically involve loading the largest possible image and then scaling it down using CSS or JavaScript, which can result in unnecessary network usage and longer loading times, particularly on slower internet connections or less powerful devices. srcset allows the browser to select the most appropriate image source, resulting in faster page load times and a better user experience.
