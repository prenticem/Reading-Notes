To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents which you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.


Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

Style	Syntax	Keyboard shortcut	Example	Output
Bold	** ** or __ __	Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux)	**This is bold text**	This is bold text
Italic	* * or _ _     	Command+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux)	*This text is italicized*	This text is italicized
Strikethrough	~~ ~~		~~This was mistaken text~~	This was mistaken text
Bold and nested italic	** ** and _ _		**This text is _extremely_ important**	This text is extremely important
All bold and italic	*** ***		***All this text is important***	All this text is important
Subscript	<sub> </sub>		<sub>This is a subscript text</sub>	This is a subscript text
Superscript	<sup> </sup>		<sup>This is a superscript text</sup>

Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

Here are the currently supported color models.

Color	Syntax	Example	Output
HEX	`#RRGGBB`	`#0969DA`	Rendered supported color model in HEX format.
RGB	`rgb(R,G,B)`	`rgb(9, 105, 218)`	Rendered supported color model in RGB format.
HSL	`hsl(H,S,L)`	`hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`	Rendered supported color model in HSL format.

Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

You can also create a Markdown hyperlink by highlighting the text and using the keyboard shortcut Command+V. If you'd like to replace the text with the link, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+V.

Images
You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

Specifying the theme an image is shown to
You can specify the theme an image is displayed for in Markdown by using the HTML <picture> element in combination with the prefers-color-scheme media feature. We distinguish between light and dark color modes, so there are two options available. You can use these options to display images optimized for dark or light backgrounds. This is particularly helpful for transparent PNG images

Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with -, *, or +.
