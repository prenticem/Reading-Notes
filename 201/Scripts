main.js
<script src="scripts/main.js"></script>

This is doing the same job as the <link> element for CSS.
const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";

The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called querySelector

Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
let myVariable;

JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!
myVariable = "Bob";
